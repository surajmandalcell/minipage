#### Adding Shortcuts

If you have not added any shortcut to Minipage yet, you should see an `Add Shortcut` button at the top-center part of your new tab page. If you already have shortcuts you can add a new one by right-clicking the new tab page and selecting `Add shortcut`.

#### Editing a Shortcut

Right-click the shortcut you want to edit and then select `Edit`. You will see a modal dialog where you can edit your shortcut's title and url.

#### Deleting a Shortcut

Right-click the shortcut you want to delete and then select `Delete`. Your shortcut will be deleted immediately.

#### Rearranging Shortcuts

Drag-and-drop shortcuts to rearrange them. The order will be saved automatically and synced across all your devices via Bookmarks.

#### Changing Minipage's Appearance

Right-click the new tab page and click `Change appearance`. You will see a modal dialog where you can select your preferred mode (light or dark), theme, and advanced settings such as time format (12hr or 24hr), keyboard shortcuts, and custom CSS style.

#### Toggle Writing Mode On/Off

Right-click the new tab page and click `Exit writing mode` or `Enter writing mode`. Alternatively, you can use the default keyboard shortcut `shift+âŒ˜` keys (`ctrl+shift` in Windows) or change it in `Change Appearance...` > `Advanced Settings` > `Writing Mode Keyboard Shortcut`
